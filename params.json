{"name":"Sparksharp","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Sparksharp.\r\nThis should be a good starting point for all _.NET_ developers involved in [Spark Core](https://www.spark.io/) projects. Spark Sharp provides _REST_ wrappers for direct Spark API calls and event parsers to make your app running clean and smooth.\r\n\r\nThe _Spark Sharp_ library is built using [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) and needs [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/) and [Json.NET](http://james.newtonking.com/json) to run, so add to your projects libraries starting from your beloved development environment.\r\n\r\nTo give it a try download the [Temperature Spark Firmware](https://github.com/Brbb/sparksharp/blob/master/temp_reader.ino) and flash your core, then clone this repo and run a test class using your own device id and access token like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing Spark;\r\n\r\nnamespace Tester\r\n{\r\n   class MainClass\r\n   {\r\n       public static void Main (string[] args)\r\n       {\r\n\t\tConfiguration.DeviceID = \"<your_device_id>\";\r\n\t\tConfiguration.AccessToken = \"<your_access_token>\";\r\n\r\n\t\tSpark.SparkResponse response =  Spark.RESTCore.SparkGetAsync (\"temperature\").Result;\r\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine(response.Result);\r\n\t}\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble? Feel free to open an issue on the [Github Project Page](https://github.com/Brbb/sparksharp/issues).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
